"""Then, set up a new table for the Titanic data (titanic.csv) - 
spend some time thinking about the schema to make sure it is 
appropriate for the columns. Enumerated types may be useful. 
Once it is set up, write a insert_titanic.py script that 
uses psycopg2 to connect to and upload the data from the csv, 
and add the file to your repo. 

Then start writing PostgreSQL queries to explore the data!"""

# Insert CSV as a pandas dataframe

# Turn that into a PostgresSQL whatever thing

# Do stuff with it
